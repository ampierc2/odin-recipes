<h3>This recipe is for the biscotti and coffee lover. Combine decadent and rich dark chocolate flavor with the best coffee companion: traditional biscotti cookies. Dip it, or don't. No matter what, enjoy. </h3>
<p>The coffee flavor comes from powdered espresso and coarsely ground espresso beans. The resulting biscotti are crunchy, sweet, and full of mocha flavor.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder Note: If you use natural cocoa powder instead of Dutch-process , use ½ teaspoon of baking soda instead of the baking powder.</li> 
    <li>2 teaspoons instant espresso powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chopped or broken into small pieces</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons unsalted butter room temperature</li>
    <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons espresso beans coarsely ground</li>
   
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>

<li>Pre-heat oven to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
<li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, cocoa,espresso powder, salt, baking powder, and chopped chocolate. Pulse until the chocolate is ground into the flour mixture.</li>
<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar.</li>
<li>Mix in the eggs and vanilla.</li>
<li>Gradually add the flour mixture just until combined.</li>
<li>Stir in the chocolate chips and ground espresso beans into the biscotti dough.</li>
<li>Divide dough in half and form two logs about 14” x 2”. Place logs on prepared baking sheet at least 4” apart for the first bake.</li>
<li>Bake for 30-35 minutes. Logs should be firm but not hard.</li>
<li>Cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes. Leave the oven on.</li>
<li>On a cutting board using a serrated knife, cut each loaf into ½ inch slices. (If the slices are crumbling, let the loaf cool a little longer.)</li>
<li>Place slices, standing ½ inch apart, on a parchment lined cookie sheet for the second bake. Bake for 30 minutes until the surface of the cookies is dry ( though the chocolate chips will be gooey).</li>
<li>Cool on a wire cooling rack. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks.</li>

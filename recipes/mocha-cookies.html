<h3>Enjoy these cookies at the office to make your work day happy.</h3>
<p>The addition of coffee extract does amazing things. It intensifies the chocolate taste and it transforms the overall cookie flavor to mocha.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup unsalted butter room temperatur</li>e
    <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons coffee extract</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    <li>2 cups milk chocolate chunks, divided</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, beat butter until light and creamy (about 3 minutes).</li>
    <li>Gradually add sugars and mix until combined.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix together the eggs and extracts,</li>
    <li>Add the egg mixture slowly to the batter</li>
    <li>Gradually add the flour mixture just until streaky.</li>
    <li>Turn off mixer and fold the batter gently with a rubber spatula until incorporated.</li>
    <li>Fold in the semisweet chip and 1 cup of the milk chocolate chunks.</li>
    <li>Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to firm (for easier scooping). Well wrapped in plastic wrap, the dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.</li>
    <li>When the dough is firm, use a medium (2 tablespoon) scoop to place cookie dough balls 2” apart on the prepared baking pan. Add 2-3 of the reserved milk chocolate chunks on top of each dough ball.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12 minutes. The center of the cookies should still be soft to the touch.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
    <li>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week</li>
</ol>

<h3>Enjoy these cookies by a toasty fireplace, consider leaving for Santa.</h3>
<p>Kept in an airtight container at room temperature, shortbread will stay fresh for 3-6 weeks. The flavor improves over time. However, the key here is room temperature. This is NOT a hot weather cookie.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li> 
   <li>1 tablespoon boiling water</li> 
   <li>1 cup butter unsalted, room temperature</li> 
   <li>⅔ cup confectioners’ sugar plus extra for dusting</li> 
   <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
   <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
   <li>1 toffee chocolate bar 3.5-4 ounces, finely chopped</li> 
   <li>¾ cup of mini chocolate chips can be used instead of the chopped chocolate bar</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
<li>In a very small bowl, dissolve the espresso powder in the boiling water.</li>
<li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and confectioner’s sugar for 3 minutes at medium speed.</li>
<li>Add the vanilla and espresso, beating until incorporated.</li>
<li>Add the flour and mix at low speed until just combined.</li>
<li>Fold in the chopped chocolate and toffee bits.</li>
<li>Transfer the cookie dough into a gallon-size zipper-lock plastic bag, but do not close the bag.</li>
<li>Roll the dough into rectangle the width of the bag and ¼” thick (approximately 9”x 11”x ¼”). While rolling, make sure no creases are formed in the dough from wrinkles in the plastic.</li> 
<li>Zip the bag closed removing as much air as possible. Refrigerate for 2 hours- 2 days.</li>
<li>When ready to bake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.</li>
<li>Cut open the zip lock plastic bag and place the dough rectangle on a cutting board.</li>
<li>Using a sharp knife or cookie cutter, cut the dough into desired shapes and transfer to the cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Use a fork to poke holes in each cookie.</li>
<li>Bake for 18-20 minutes.</li>
<li>Dust with confectioner’s sugar while the cookies are still hot.</li>
<li>Let the shortbread cool completely on a wire rack before storing.</li>
<li>Store at room temperature in an airtight container for at least 3 weeks.</li>
